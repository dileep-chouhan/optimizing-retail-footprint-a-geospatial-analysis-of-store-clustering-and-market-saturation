# Optimizing Retail Footprint: A Geospatial Analysis of Store Clustering and Market Saturation

## Overview

This project performs a geospatial analysis to optimize retail footprint by identifying areas of market saturation and potential new store locations.  The analysis leverages the spatial distribution of existing stores, incorporating demographic and competitive data to maximize market penetration and profitability.  The project identifies clusters of existing stores, calculates market saturation indices, and visually represents the findings through maps and charts.

## Technologies Used

* Python 3
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Geopandas (for geospatial analysis)
* [Add other libraries as needed]


## How to Run

1. **Install Dependencies:**  Ensure you have Python 3 installed. Then, navigate to the project directory in your terminal and install the required Python libraries using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the Analysis:** Execute the main script:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

   This will perform the geospatial analysis and generate the output described below.  Ensure that all necessary data files (specified within the code) are present in the correct directory.

## Example Output

The script will print key findings to the console, including:

* Summary statistics on store density and market saturation in different regions.
* Identification of potential new store locations based on calculated indices.
* [Add other key output metrics]

Additionally, the project generates several visualizations saved as image files in the `output` directory (create this directory if it doesn't exist):

* **`store_distribution.png`**: A map visualizing the spatial distribution of existing stores.
* **`market_saturation.png`**: A map showing market saturation levels across the study area.
* **`potential_locations.png`**: A map highlighting potential locations for new stores.
* [Add other generated plot file names]

These visualizations provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the analysis results.  The specific output might vary depending on the input data.
